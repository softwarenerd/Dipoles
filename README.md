# Dipoles
There are numerous online dipole calculators. Since the bands in Amateur Radio don't change very frequently, the chart below shows calculations for each Amateur Radio band and, in the case of 28.0 MHz - 29.7 MHz (10 Meters) and 3.5 MHz - 4.0 MHz (80 Meters / 75 Meters), segments of the bands since these bands are so large.

Additionally, the chart shows the Flat Top dimensions and Inverted V dimensions, which are calculated to be 5% shorter than the the Flat Top dimensions.
